GUI stands for graphical user interface. It allows the user to more easily access information, through the use of visuals and audio instead of relying only on text.
In an event driven application, code is executed by direct user actions, such as the click of a button.
Components are added to the content pane, which is the part of the frame that holds visual information. In this way, components can be directly added to a frame.
An action listener can be used with a JLabel in order to respond to events.
Invoking swing objects from multiple threads risks thread interference so to avoid this an event-dispatching thread is used.
A label contains information such as text or a picture and a button triggers an event.
