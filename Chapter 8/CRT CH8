1. An is-a relationship refers to inheritance, which is when a child class uses information from a parent class. In a has-a relationship an instance of one class has a reference to an instance of another class.
2. A derived class will have its own methods as well as the methods from its base class at its disposal. If the base class has a public method go(), and the derived class has a public method stop(), then an object of the derived class can use methods go() and stop().
3. An abstract method is not implemented within the super-class, it is inherited by the derived class and used as detailed in the super-class. An overridden method is implemented by the super-class, and is then changed by the derived class before being implemented.
4. An interface is an abstract type that specifies what actions classes must take. An abstract class uses the abstract keyword and contains methods that are used by other classes.
